This tool stands out for its unparalleled optimization for lightning-fast thumbnail generation. By utilizing minimal
resources, you can generate more in less time. And with a user-friendly CLI and a convenient Python API, this tool is
the ultimate solution for efficient and streamlined thumbnail creation.

## Compatible with Major Video Players

Modern web video players use the **WebVTT** formatted files to preview thumbnails at a pointed time.
[WebVTT](https://www.w3.org/TR/webvtt1/) is a format for displaying timed text tracks (such as subtitles or captions).
Open-source video players such as [Plyr](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr), [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js),
[Flowplayer](https://github.com/flowplayer/flowplayer), [Fluid Player](https://github.com/fluid-player/fluid-player),
and more, use this format for showing the thumbnails. And, with the use of [external plugins](https://github.com/brightcove/videojs-thumbnails),
Video.js even has the capability to handle **JSON** formatted thumbnail metadata. This is where our tool comes in,
offering the ability to generate the perfect thumbnails to match your needs.

## Features

- Wide-ranging video format compatibility, accommodating all major video formats as input files. (mp4, mkv, avi, mov, ogv, webm, mpeg, mpg, wmv, etc.)
- Flexible output options, supporting both WebVTT and JSON formats.
- Generating video thumbnails through the CLI and the Python API.
- Customize your thumbnail creation to fit your specific needs with various options.
- Image compression technology, ensuring optimized file sizes for quick and efficient loading times.

## How to Use?

### CLI Tool Usage

The CLI is a convenient way to generate thumbnails for a video file. And it accepts files or directories as arguments.
For the complete list of options, run `thumbnails --help`.

```bash
thumbnails --base /media/ --output /var/www/movie.com/media/thumbnails/ --interval 5 ~Videos/movies
```

### Python API Usage

The Python API provides a flexible way to integrate video thumbnail generation into your existing applications.
Both the CLI and the Python API share the same set of options.

```python
from thumbnails import Generator

inputs = (
    "~Downloads/movie.mp4",
    "~Videos/movies/1.avi",
    "~Videos/movies/2.ogv",
)

generator = Generator(inputs)
generator.base = "/media/"
generator.skip = True  # skip existing thumbnails
generator.output = "/var/www/movie.com/media/thumbnails/"
generator.interval = 5
generator.generate()
```

## Development

Run the following command in the package's root directory to install it in editable mode.
